As part of the Qwen2.5 series, it features enhanced knowledge, stronger coding and math abilities, improved instruction following, better handling of long and structured texts, and supports up to 128K context tokens. It also offers multilingual capabilities across over 29 languages.\n\nLLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct:LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct is an 8-billion-parameter instruction-tuned language model optimized for multilingual dialogue. It provides strong language understanding, reasoning, and text generation performance, outperforming many open-source and closed-source models on standard industry benchmarks.\n\nLLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct:LLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct is a 70-billion-parameter state-of-the-art language model designed for advanced multilingual dialogue tasks. It excels in language comprehension, complex reasoning, and high-quality text generation, setting a new standard against both open and closed models in benchmark evaluations.\n\nMistral-7B-Instruct:Mistral-7B-Instruct is a fine-tuned version of the Mistral-7B-v0.3 language model designed to follow instructions, complete user requests, and generate creative text. It was trained on diverse public conversation datasets to enhance its ability to handle interactive tasks effectively.\n\nMixtral-8x22B-Instruct:Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct is a cutting-edge sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) large language model from MistralAI. It efficiently uses 39B active parameters out of 141B total, delivering high performance at lower costs. The model excels at following instructions, completing tasks, and generating creative text, with strong skills in multiple languages (English, French, Italian, German, Spanish), mathematics, and coding. It also supports native function calling and handles long contexts up to 64K tokens for better information recall.\n\nGemma-2-27B-Instruct:Gemma-2-27B-Instruct is a cutting-edge, instruction-tuned text generation model developed by Google. Built using the same technology as Gemini, it excels at text understanding, transformation, and code generation. As a lightweight, decoder-only model with open weights, it is ideal for tasks like question answering, summarization, and reasoning. Its compact size enables deployment on laptops, desktops, or private cloud setups, making powerful AI more accessible.\n\nIf you find that no further external knowledge is needed, you can directly provide your final answer inside <answer> ... <\/answer>, without additional explanation or illustration.

As part of the Qwen2.5 series, it features enhanced knowledge, stronger coding and math abilities, improved instruction following, better handling of long and structured texts, and supports up to 128K context tokens. It also offers multilingual capabilities across over 29 languages.\n\nLLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct:LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct is an 8-billion-parameter instruction-tuned language model optimized for multilingual dialogue. It provides strong language understanding, reasoning, and text generation performance, outperforming many open-source and closed-source models on standard industry benchmarks.\n\nLLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct:LLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct is a 70-billion-parameter state-of-the-art language model designed for advanced multilingual dialogue tasks. It excels in language comprehension, complex reasoning, and high-quality text generation, setting a new standard against both open and closed models in benchmark evaluations.\n\nMistral-7B-Instruct:Mistral-7B-Instruct is a fine-tuned version of the Mistral-7B-v0.3 language model designed to follow instructions, complete user requests, and generate creative text. It was trained on diverse public conversation datasets to enhance its ability to handle interactive tasks effectively.\n\nMixtral-8x22B-Instruct:Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct is a cutting-edge sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) large language model from MistralAI. It efficiently uses 39B active parameters out of 141B total, delivering high performance at lower costs. The model excels at following instructions, completing tasks, and generating creative text, with strong skills in multiple languages (English, French, Italian, German, Spanish), mathematics, and coding. It also supports native function calling and handles long contexts up to 64K tokens for better information recall.\n\nGemma-2-27B-Instruct:Gemma-2-27B-Instruct is a cutting-edge, instruction-tuned text generation model developed by Google. Built using the same technology as Gemini, it excels at text understanding, transformation, and code generation. As a lightweight, decoder-only model with open weights, it is ideal for tasks like question answering, summarization, and reasoning. Its compact size enables deployment on laptops, desktops, or private cloud setups, making powerful AI more accessible.\n\nIf you find that no further external knowledge is needed, you can directly provide your final answer inside <answer> ... <\/answer>, without additional explanation or illustration.
